    "changelog": "v0.3.1\\n>Follow the instructions on README.md to know how to install ONScripter-NX.\\n>\\n>Game-specific zips are just convenience builds.\\n>They already come with some of the necessary files included, so you just need to copy the arc.nsa/arc.sar files from an original copy of the game.\\n\\n\\nChangelog:\\n\\n- Compatibility with v21.0.0- - Recompiled with latest libnx to allow compatibility with the latest ABI changes.\\n- Debug to PC with nxlink.\\n    - Now ONScripter-NX uses nxlinkStdio to stream both stdout and stderr to the nxlink server on debug builds. This allows for easier debugging, but most importantly it's a much better thought approach than the previous one.\\n    - ONScripter-NX used to log output to _stdout.txt_ and _stderr.txt_ on the SD card, consistently with ONScripter's standard behavior on Windows.\\nONScripter-NX logs a lot- in debug builds; that would mean continuous writes to the SD card for the entire process lifetime (and also heavy write amplification). This is indeed problematic for SD flash storage health and, potentially, performance (even though it didn't seem to cause noticeable slowdowns under casual circumstances yet).\\n    \\n- Fixed crash on program exit.\\n    - Undefined behavior inside the input handling thread caused the program to crash upon exiting. This is fixed now.\\n\\n0.3\\n\\nThank you for your patience!\\nIt's been eight months, I know, but I hope that this was worth the wait!\\n\\nWith every update ONScripter-NX becomes more and more complete. I want people to enjoy their beloved novels on their Switch while feeling at ease, not with a chunky app that doesn't do the work right. With this update I tweaked the engine a bit to improve the playing experience in the long run. I hope I've made progress towards my goal, improving your playing experience too!\\n\\nFollow the instructions on README.md to know how to install ONScripter-NX.\\n\\nGame-specific zips are just convenience builds.\\nThey already come with some of the necessary files included, so you just need to copy the arc*.nsa/arc*.sar files from an original copy of the game.\\n\\nChangelog:\\n\\nHD support - yes! Play your old novel like you had never been able to! More info about it in the README page (seriously, read it!)\\nA new command has been added to adjust text display speed.\\nBy pressing the Left Stick, you can switch between the three available text display speeds (slow~normal~fast).\\nONScripter-NX will also memorize your selected text speed for that game.\\nMenu navigation is now a lot easier thanks to repeated input support.\\nNow you can hold the stick to scroll menu entries faster.\\nThis also works when navigating text history using D-Up and D-Down, and basically in every other directional input use case too.\\nNow the app deinitializes RomFS properly at shutdown.\\nA proper deinit function has been created. It will be called at app's shutdown, and will be eventually populated with more deinitializing code, if needed in the future. For now it just contains the RomFS deinit call...",
