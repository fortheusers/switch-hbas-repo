    "changelog": "0.3.1\\nCompatibility with v21.0.0 - Recompiled with latest libnx to allow compatibility with the latest ABI changes.\\n\\nDebug to PC with nxlink.\\n\\nNow ONScripter-NX uses nxlinkStdio to stream both stdout and stderr to the nxlink server on debug builds. This allows for easier debugging, but most importantly it's a much better thought approach than the previous one.\\nONScripter-NX used to log output to stdout.txt and stderr.txt on the SD card, consistently with ONScripter's standard behavior on Windows.\\nONScripter-NX logs a lot in debug builds; that would mean continuous writes to the SD card for the entire process lifetime (and also heavy write amplification). This is indeed problematic for SD flash storage health and, potentially, performance (even though it didn't seem to cause noticeable slowdowns under casual circumstances yet).\\nFixed crash on program exit.\\n\\nUndefined behavior inside the input handling thread caused the program to crash upon exiting. This is fixed now",
