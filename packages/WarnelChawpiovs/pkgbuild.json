It can be deactivated in the options to unlock everything directly\\n- The game is now much more \"verbose\" with popups that give details on what's going on. These can be dismissed for a given game by selecting \"don't show this tip again\" or entirely deactivated in the options (Options > Gameplay > Notifications > \"Expert\")\\n- \"Text mode\" is now considered playable. This allows to play if you can't or won't download image files. You might want to open the settings.json file and set \"load_cards_online\": false to avoid the game trying to download image resources on startup. (Note: you still need the set definitions to be downloaded from marvelcdb)\\n- Caped FPS to 60FPS\\n- Various bug fixes\\n\\nInitial release. Supports 5 heroes and 3 villains"
