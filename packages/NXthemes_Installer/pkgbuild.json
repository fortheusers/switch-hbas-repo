    "changelog": "4.8\\nThis release of the theme tools brings support for the new 20.0 firmware as well as support for replacing the icons of all the new applet icons.\\n\\nCompatibility with 20.0\\n\\nSince the new firmware changes some aspects of the home menu layout the installer will try to fix old themes automatically. With the feedback of a few people who tested the beta builds and my testing of the most popular layouts on themezer i can say most themes should work fine with only minor UI differences.\\n\\nWe know of one specific layout that is currently broken on 20.0 and i expect a few more will pop up along the way, in those cases the layout author will have to manually fix it and provide a 20.0 compatible version.\\n\\nMaking 20.0 layouts\\n\\nIf you're making layouts and want to make sure they work on all fimware versions you should be careful to not move the applet icons around otherwise they will leave empty spots when the layout is installed on an older firmware, you can read more on the wiki.\\n\\nIf you made a 20.0 theme before this release you should diff your layout again with latest layout editor otherwise it might not show properly due to the auto fix mistaking it for an old layout.\\n\\nFinally, i'd like to thank @new-waifu, @ELY3M and @Migushthe2nd and the others on discord for the help in getting this release done and tested.\\n\\n4.7.1\\n\\nSupport for 17.0\\nExpose patch templates functionality in the PC theme injector, allows for patching custom szs files\\nMinor changes in bflan serialization, mostly for the layout editor",
