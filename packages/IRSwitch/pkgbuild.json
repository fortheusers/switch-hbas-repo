        "details": "A homebrew app for the switch that allows you to view the Switch's IR camera on the right joy-con that is steamed to the switch's screen.\\n\\nFeatures:\\n\u2022 Change the resolution\\n\\n\u2022 Hide the UI\\n\\n\u2022 Switch between greyscale and thermal colour*\\n\\n\u2022 Turn the IR led off\\n\\n\u2022 Detach the controllers\\n\\n*The thermal colour mode shows the amount of InfraRed light that is received by the InfraRed sensor. It is NOT a thermal camera because the sensor only detects shorter infrared wavelengths of around 850-940nm that are emitted by a TV remote for example. It cannot detect heat's wavelength.\\n\\nControls:\\n\u2022 Press left stick to hide/show UI\\n\\n\u2022 Up/Down on D-PAD to switch between thermal/greyscale\\n\\n\u2022 Left/Right on D-PAD to change resolution\\n\\n\u2022 - to turn off IR LED"
