See below for the full changelog.\\n\\nNew users landing on this release page should first check out the readme on the main project page: https://github.com/ndeadly/MissionControlreadme for the official project documentation. There you can find installation and usage instructions along with an FAQ section that will answer most of your questions.\\n\\n Changelog\\n- Added support for firmware 20.2.0\\n- Fixed incorrect offsets in exefs patches for 20.x.x affecting xbox elite v2 controller pairing\\n\\n0.13.2\\nThis release adds full support for firmware 20.1.0, and whitelists a new official controller type introduced in the new firmware.\\n- Added support for firmware 20.1.0\\n- Added support for new Lic3 Pro Controller type\\n\\n0.13.1\\nJust a quick bugfix release to address a few oversights in the original 0.13.0 release. There was a regression due to changing the reported controller type to Licensed Pro Controller, which doesn't have support for rumble or reporting battery levels. The hid patches have been updated to add the missing flags and restore the functionality for controllers emulated through Mission Control. See below for the full changelog.\\n\\nNote: setting new flags for the Licensed Pro Controller type may also activate missing features on actual licensed 3rd party Pro Controllers (e.g. battery level reporting) if the controller happens to implement them. Don't expect any miracles (rumble isn't going to start working on a controller without motors). Please also let me know if these patches have any adverse effects\\n\\n0.13.0\\nThis release brings full support for firmware 20.0.0 and 20.0.1, an implementation of a new quaternion based motion format found in newer controller firmwares (thanks @Banz99) along with various other bugfixes and improvements.\\n\\nFull changelog:\\nAdded full support for 20.0.X firmwares\\nAdded implementation of new quaternion based motion data format.\\nAdded exefs patches for hid to modify supported feature flags for third-party Licensed Pro Controllers. Button remapping, analog stick and motion calibration are now enabled.\\nChanged emulated controller type to Licensed Pro Controller. This prevents the console from attempting to read NFC data from emulated controllers which was causing freezing and screeching audio in some games.\\nSysmodule no longer initialises btm/btm:sys services on startup in order to leave sessions available to other homebrew applications.\\nAdded a mechanism via bluetooth exefs patches for implementing custom commands called via the WriteHidData2 IPC function. This allows exposing internal bluetooth stack functions.\\nAdded IPC commands to the mc service to expose calls for sending arbitrary HCI commands and calling the internal BSA_DmSetConfig function.\\nAdded a mechanism for external software making use of hid report event redirection to either consume redirected events or forward them back to the system.",
