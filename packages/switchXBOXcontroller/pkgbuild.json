    "changelog": "1.0.0.0\\nFirst release, this could be unstable!\\n\\nI mostly tested it on my V1 Switch on firmwares 19.0, 20.5 and 21.0, but further testing will be needed. I noticed that some crashes may occur when using the exit shortcut (minus + plus), but I still haven't identified the root cause of it\\n\\nWhat's changed:\\n- Migration to libnx 4.10, refactor main.c by @Vins98 in #1\\n- Migration to .NET Framework 4.8, WinForms and ViGEmBus by @Vins98 in #2",
