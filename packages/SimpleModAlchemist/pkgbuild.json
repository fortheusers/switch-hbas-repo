    "changelog": "v1.1\\n- Feature:- When having the app randomly pick the mods, the likelihood of each mod can now be adjusted.\\n  - Press Y- on a mod to show a dialog for adjusting the probabilities.\\n- ISSUE-4: https://github.com/gtiersma/Simple_Mod_Alchemist/issues/4 (_Start games from within the app_)\\n  - When viewing a game's mods, that specific game can now be launched directly from the app by pressing +.\\n- Fix:- ISSUE-10: https://github.com/gtiersma/Simple_Mod_Alchemist/issues/10 (_Some mod files can get \"stuck\" active with some mods that have multiple files_)\\n- Fix:- ISSUE-8: https://github.com/gtiersma/Simple_Mod_Alchemist/issues/8 (_remove contents after disable_)\\n- Fix:- When migrating mods from SimpleModManager, there should no longer be a risk of left-over files or files that failed the migration being deleted.\\n- ISSUE-13: https://github.com/gtiersma/Simple_Mod_Alchemist/issues/13 (_Make automatic SMM mod migration feature more obvious_)\\n  - When Simple Mod Alchemist is started when there are no game folders found, a button is showed front-and-center for migrating mods from SimpleModManager.\\n- Fix:- For those that may have mods that were used in State Alchemist, mods that were \"random locked\" from that app will no longer be stuck locked in Simple Mod Alchemist. Locking status is now ignored.\\n  - There is currently no plan to implement \"random locking\" in Simple Mod Alchemist because this app is capable of randomly changing mods individually or by group. This should be better in most cases, but if there's a demand for locking to return, that could be considered.\\n- Added scrolling to the About tab. It's no longer so cramped.\\n- Label/description clarity/conciseness improvements.\\n\\nv1.0.1\\n- The app was recompiled using the latest version of libnx for support of Atmosphère v1.10.0.\\n- Feature: Mods can now be changed at random.\\n  - Individually, by group or by game\\n  - This can be done by pressing X- on a mod, group or game.\\n  - This can also be done through the new option in the game settings.\\n- A working progress bar was created. It's used in the dialogs that appear when:\\n  - Randomly changing multiple mods at a time.\\n  - Disabling all mods in a game.\\n  - Bringing over mods from SimpleModManager.\\n- Fix: The game list now refreshes after bringing over mods from SimpleModManager. No need to relaunch the app.\\n- When bringing over mods from SimpleModManager, no longer will any of SimpleModManager's folders be deleted under any circumstance unless they contain no files after the migration.\\n- Minor improvements were made to the layout of dialogs.\\n\\nv1.0 - INITIAL RELEASE\\nForked from SimpleModManager. Initial major changes:\\n* Full UI upgrade, fixing data-access crashing errors from the old version\\n* Mods are categorized in groups and by what they replace\\n* Huge speed boost (mod files are moved, not copied)\\n* Can automatically bring over mods from SimpleModManager to start using right away\\n* Scalable - it now safe to use with lists of hundreds of mods\\n* More to come!"
