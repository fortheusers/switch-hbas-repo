    "changelog": "v1.4.4\\nFix an issue where GetDefaultDisplayResolution could return 0x0 in some cases, leading to game crash.\\n\\nv1.4.2\\n- Fix an issue with Red Dead Redemption not detecting properly if it's in docked mode or handheld for NX-FPS internal use, causing FPS lock issues in docked mode\\n- Optimize dumping resolutions\\n\\nv1.4.0\\n- Read separately FPS targets for docked and handheld from FPSLocker save (requires FPSLocker 2.3.0+)\\n- Add SaltyNX version to logs of sysmodule and Cores\\n- Fix an issue with sysmodule not injecting Core anymore to next games if Core initialization failed which resulted in game crash before Core had a chance to close connection\\n- Improve NX-FPS's PFPS stat reporting\\n- Read separate docked overclocking settings for 720p (requires FPSLocker 2.3.0+)\\n- Now game read speed in Core is opt-out instead of opt-in (to get game read speed use Status Monitor Overlay 1.2.0+)\\n\\nv1.3.1\\n- Separate display sync for handheld and docked (Requires FPSLocker 2.2.1+ for proper support)\\n- Fix memory leak related to reading external display's config (it was crashing system)\\n- Give an option to measure game files read speed if filestats.flag exists\\n\\nv1.3.0-release\\n- Add support for overclocking compatible external display's refresh rate up to 120 Hz\\n- Add support for downclocking OLED internal display refresh rate down to 45 Hz\\n- Add support for downclocking Retro Remake SUPER5 refresh rate down to 40 Hz (with initial support for other Retro Remake displays)\\n- Fix an issue with not clearing shared memory after application is closed, resulting in tools such as Status Monitor and FPSLocker reporting false values\\n\\nRequires FPSLocker 2.2.0 and newer to properly utilize new functions.

With this fix it's now less than 5 seconds).\\nSysmodule log now prints info how much time have passed since sysmodule booted.\\nMinor sysmodule optimizations",
