    "changelog": "v1.5.0\\n- Add support for next generation of FPSLocker patches introduced in FPSLocker 3.0.0 release\\n- Fix compatibility with Unity 6 games (Hollow Knight Silksong, Disney Dreamlight Valley 1.18.0)\\n- NX-FPS: report resolutions only with width higher than 160 px\\n- FPSLocker patch is now applied every frame in handheld instead of every second. This can cause crashes with some old patches on game's boot, it can be solved by removing patch in FPSLocker, downloading new config with FPSLocker 3.0.0+ and creating from it new patch\\n- With each new release \"Debug_files.zip\" will be included for easier debugging of specific release version\\n\\nv1.4.8\\nFix a bug introduced in 1.4.3 release with underclocked OLED not readjusting colors after waking from sleep.\\n\\nv1.4.7\\nFixed a bug in vulkan layer, causing crash in Until Then game\\n\\nv1.4.6\\n- Share how many frames were generated by game (this fixes an issue with Status Monitor \"FPS Graph\" wrongly detecting paused games for brief moments, update Status Monitor to get proper support)\\n\\nv1.4.5\\nFix reporting doubled FPS value in Crypt of the NecroDancer\\n\\nv1.4.4\\nFix an issue where GetDefaultDisplayResolution could return 0x0 in some cases, leading to game crash.\\n\\nv1.4.3\\n- Add option to always force 60 Hz when in HOME Menu while Display Sync is turned on (requires FPSLocker 2.3.1+)\\n- Add support for overriding Default Display Resolution (Requires ReverseNX-RT 2.3.0+)\\n- Fix an issue for V1 and V2 models which in docked mode would report 0Hz if user was not using display sync\\n\\nShadow update 05.08.2025 07:16 GMT: Fixed an issue where disabling system control in ReverseNX-RT didn't update custom DDR in game.\\n\\nv1.4.2\\n- Fix an issue with Red Dead Redemption not detecting properly if it's in docked mode or handheld for NX-FPS internal use, causing FPS lock issues in docked mode\\n- Optimize dumping resolutions\\n\\nv1.4.0\\n- Read separately FPS targets for docked and handheld from FPSLocker save (requires FPSLocker 2.3.0+)\\n- Add SaltyNX version to logs of sysmodule and Cores\\n- Fix an issue with sysmodule not injecting Core anymore to next games if Core initialization failed which resulted in game crash before Core had a chance to close connection\\n- Improve NX-FPS's PFPS stat reporting\\n- Read separate docked overclocking settings for 720p (requires FPSLocker 2.3.0+)\\n- Now game read speed in Core is opt-out instead of opt-in (to get game read speed use Status Monitor Overlay 1.2.0+)\\n\\nv1.3.1\\n- Separate display sync for handheld and docked (Requires FPSLocker 2.2.1+ for proper support)\\n- Fix memory leak related to reading external display's config (it was crashing system)\\n- Give an option to measure game files read speed if filestats.flag exists\\n\\nv1.3.0-release\\n- Add support for overclocking compatible external display's refresh rate up to 120 Hz\\n- Add support for downclocking OLED internal display refresh rate down to 45 Hz\\n- Add support for downclocking Retro Remake SUPER5 refresh rate down to 40 Hz (with initial support for other Retro Remake displays)\\n- Fix an issue with not clearing shared memory after application is closed, resulting in tools such as Status Monitor and FPSLocker reporting false values\\n\\nRequires FPSLocker 2.2.0 and newer to properly utilize new functions. Its readme also has more informations about specific issues related to new functions.\\n\\n1.2.7\\nFix crash in some units when going to sleep mode (bug introduced in 1.2.6).\\n\\n1.2.5\\nAdd option to force game into custom made suspend when in Home Menu (requires FPSLocker 2.1.3+).\\n\\n1.2.4\\nFix FPS Lock not working when Display Sync was disabled.\\nReport proper interval for EGL if game is passing invalid value\\n\\n1.2.3\\nReduce size of Core32 by 15% and Core by 35% which allows us to make sysmodule take 64kB less RAM\\nAllow changing amount of buffers in Vulkan games (requires FPSLocker 1.2.2+)\\nFix an issue with some games overreporting frames (120 instead of 60), such as Hades\\nFix an issue where very few Erista units had constant image stutters and loading times increased since 1.2.0 release\\n\\n1.2.2\\nFixed an old bug where games with big .bss segment were booting significantly longer than other games (For example games using Regista or LucaSystem engine were booting 30-40 seconds. With this fix it's now less than 5 seconds).\\nSysmodule log now prints info how much time have passed since sysmodule booted.\\nMinor sysmodule optimizations",
