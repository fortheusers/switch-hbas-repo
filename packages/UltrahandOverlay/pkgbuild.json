        "details": "WARNING: This will overwrite Tesla Menu if already installed. Includes ppkantorski's nx-ovlloader fork. \\n\\nUltrahand Overlay is a Tesla Menu replacement built from the ground up off of libtesla that provides powerful C/C++ commands through the usage of its own custom interpretive programming language (similar to Shell/BASH). It is a versatile tool that enables you to create and share custom command-based packages, providing enhanced functionality for managing files and directories on your SD card.\\n\\nWith Ultrahand, you have the flexibility to customize and shape your file management system according to your needs, empowering you with greater control over your system configurations.\\n\\nSupport the dev on Ko-fi: https://ko-fi.com/ppkantorski"

    "changelog": "v2.1.8\\nList of changes:\\n1. AMS 1.10.0+ and HOS 21 support.\\n    - Overlays not recompiled with latest libnx no longer work without manual force enabling (potentially dangerous).\\n    - Unsupported overlays can now be hidden (toggle is within the settings menu).\\n        - Important:- All homebrew on AMS 1.10+ must to be recompiled with latest libnx for properly ensured support.\\n2. Anti-aliasing is now applied to rounded rects, uniform rounded rects, bordered rounded rects, and circles.\\n    - Overall smoother, less pixelated / jagged edges.\\n3. Slightly improved wallpaper loading speed + menu opening speed.\\n4. Memory expansion toggle / notification bug fix.\\n5. Initial state bug fix for main settings menu toggles.\\n6. Bug fix for ini file saving. (buffer was too large)\\n    - This fixes the open overlay command in Ultrahand packages.\\n7. Bug fix for ini file parsing not returning null on failed parsings.\\n8. Fixed Chinese font selection to ensure all glyphs display correctly on Traditional Chinese systems.\\n    - Special thanks to @BadFish-HSrui.\\n9. nx-ovlloader/nx-ovlloader+ has now been updated (v1.1.2) for AMS 1.10+ support.\\n10. libnx has been manually recompiled with -Os as well as several other code generation optimizations.\\n11. Various minor bug fixes and corrections.\\n\\nv2.1.7\\nList of changes:\\n1. Bug fix for notification text being drawn transparent when hidden (related to the global alpha limiter).\\n2. Bug fix for toggling Memory Expansion preventing users from exiting the Ultrahand settings menu.\\n3. Ini method optimizations (faster loading).\\n4. Proper menu return to last selected overlay / package when version labels are hidden.\\n    - A unique ID is now used to facilitate precise returns.\\n5. Widget backdrop now utilizes the alpha limiter.\\n6. Language config map (for the initial and repeated parsing of languages) is no longer static.\\n    - This should free up more memory in the global heap.\\n7. Slight improvements for haptics initializations (to prevent failed initializations that sometimes happen on first boot).\\n7. Various minor code optimizations.\\n\\nv2.1.6\\nList of changes:\\n1. Proper return to the last selected item after changing settings in the main Ultrahand settings menu.  \\n    - Ultrahand settings menu can also now be entered from the hidden overlays / packages page.  \\n2. Improved shake highlight animation.  \\n3. Faster wallpaper loading.  \\n4. Various rendering optimizations.  \\n5. Global alpha limiter for glyph rendering.\\n    - This will improve appearances when transitioning from shown to hidden and vise versa.\\n    - renderer->a is no longer needed for drawString calls in libultrahand.  \\n6. Bug fix for click animation not triggering on toggle list items.  \\n7. Various code optimizations (8kb smaller than v2.1.5).\\n\\nv2.1.5\\nList of changes:\\n1. New haptic feedback and sound effects options in Features under Miscellaneous in the settings menu.\\n    - Haptic feedback is off by default.\\n    - Sound effects are on by default, but require sound files: https://github.com/ppkantorski/Ultrahand-Overlay/tree/main/sounds to be added to /config/ultrahand/sounds/.\\n        - Users updating to v2.1.5 must run Update from the Software Update page one more time after updating  for the included sound effects to be properly installed.\\n        - Users can manually disable updates of the sound effect files by adding a file named NO_SOUND_EFFECTS_UPDATES.flag into /config/ultrahand/flags/.\\n    - Sound effects are only enabled on nx-ovlloader+, not regular nx-ovloader.\\n    - Side-note:- Sounds and haptics will also be applied to every overlay compiled with libultrahand v2.1.5+.\\n    - Notice:- Sound files must be relatively small to prevent memory related issues and keep latency low.\\n2. Transition bug fixes for cached List frames.\\n    - These fixes ensure the overlay list changes are synchronized with the top and bottom parts of the OverlayFrame during menu transitions.\\n3. Various refinements and bug fixes to the download file command.\\n    - Buffer sizes have been tweaked, memory related improvements applied, and boundary case crashes resolved.\\n4. Memory related improvements for copy and move commands running on the interpreter thread.\\n5. The \"Selection is empty!\" message is now properly centered, and applied to the overlay menu when no overlays have been added.\\n    - This ensures that translations are properly center text instead of drawing text misaligned.\\n6. Memory related improvements to wallpaper loading / reloading.\\n7. Cleanup of notification processing queue.\\n8. Cleanup of screenshots and recording layer initializations.\\n9. Various code refinements, bug fixes, and tweaks.",
