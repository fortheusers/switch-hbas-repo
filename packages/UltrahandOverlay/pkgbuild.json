        "details": "WARNING: This will overwrite Tesla Menu if already installed.\\n\\nUltrahand Overlay is a Tesla Menu replacement built from the ground up off of libtesla that provides powerful C/C++ commands through the usage of its own custom interpretive programming language (similar to Shell/BASH). It is a versatile tool that enables you to create and share custom command-based packages, providing enhanced functionality for managing files and directories on your SD card.\\n\\nWith Ultrahand, you have the flexibility to customize and shape your file management system according to your needs, empowering you with greater control over your system configurations."

    "changelog": "v1.9.1\\nList of changes:\\n1. Significant rendering improvements in libultrahand / libtesla (again 🙂).\\n    - Faster string rendering (with safeguards) as well as rendering of other objects.\\n    - Faster glyph lookup (for drawing strings).\\n    - Safe optimizations to critical rendering components (considerable improvements).\\n    - 60fps now works on 918 MHz CPU with wallpapers.\\n    - 60fps also works with 714 MHz CPU without wallpapers.\\n        - 612 Mhz CPU without wallpapers is now very close to 60fps with it rendering 60fps on certain menus.\\n2. Bug fixes for left to right scrolling text (long ListItem text) not returning to its original position before restarting.\\n3. Rewrite of the List class in libtesla to properly allow jump menu navigation.\\n    - When at the top of the menu and up is pressed, the cursor will now automatically go to the bottom most item.\\n    - When at the bottom of the menu and down is pressed, the cursor will now automatically go back to the top.\\n    - When L is pressed, the cursor will jump to the top of the menu.\\n    - When R is pressed, the cursor will jump to the bottom of the menu. \\n        - All jump menu implementations works on menus with ListItems and tables, or even just tables.\\n    - Complete rewrite of the table scrolling implementation for smoother scrolling and less potential issues.\\n4. Fixes to table drawing implementations.\\n    - All tables are now ;scrollable=true by default with proper scrolling implemented.\\n        - This property will eventually be removed, as well as the other scrollable properties.\\n5. Download commands now have a 10s timeout.\\n6. Software Update now removes the version label if it cannot pull the latest version details from GitHub.\\n    - This will prevent people thinking an older version of the overlay is the latest.\\n7. Slight cleanup of debug logging.\\n8. Beta for nx-ovlloader+ v1.1.1: https://github.com/ppkantorski/nx-ovlloader/releases/tag/v1.1.1 is now live (not linked to Update for now for testing).\\n\\n What's Changed\\n Tweak for dist target by @impeeza in https://github.com/ppkantorski/Ultrahand-Overlay/pull/232\\n\\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/ppkantorski/Ultrahand-Overlay/compare/215e878...v1.9.1\\n\\n1.9.0\\nTitle ID polling bug fixes in libultrahand (cleanup of the foreground fix implementation).\\n- Before it was using old / outdated service calls for pulling the title ID.\\n- This issue appears to have caused crashes on certain switch environments according to users.\\nVarious code optimizations in libultrahand.\\n- Rendering is slightly faster now than v1.8.9.\\n- Removal of chrono for libnx alternatives.\\nnx-ovlloader/nx-ovlloader+ have been re-compiled",
