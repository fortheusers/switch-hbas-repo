        "details": "WARNING: This will overwrite Tesla Menu if already installed. Includes ppkantorski's nx-ovlloader fork. \\n\\nUltrahand Overlay is a Tesla Menu replacement built from the ground up off of libtesla that provides powerful C/C++ commands through the usage of its own custom interpretive programming language (similar to Shell/BASH). It is a versatile tool that enables you to create and share custom command-based packages, providing enhanced functionality for managing files and directories on your SD card.\\n\\nWith Ultrahand, you have the flexibility to customize and shape your file management system according to your needs, empowering you with greater control over your system configurations.\\n\\nSupport the dev on Ko-fi: https://ko-fi.com/ppkantorski"

    "changelog": "v2.2.0\\nList of changes:\\n1. New overlay heap size configurations with automatic reloads (in the System Settings menu).\\n    - Default heap size for HOS 21+ is now set to 4MB (displayed as nx-ovlloader-).\\n        - Although rare, some overlays may not work properly on 4MB (without a fix implemented).\\n            - To fix some of these overlays, they should be using socketInitialize instead of socketInitializeDefault (if utilized).\\n            - Overlays should also not be utilizing a full 1280x720p framebuffer when on 4MB.\\n    - Default heap size for HOS 20 is now set to 6MB (displayed as nx-ovlloader).\\n    - Default heap size for HOS 19 and lower is now set to 8MB (displayed as nx-ovlloader+).\\n    - Users can also add a 4th higher option by adding to /config/ultrahand/config.ini a new section memory with key custom_overlay_memory_MB and an integer value (2MB intervals greater than 8MB only).\\n        - After adding that entry, a 4th memory option will appear (displayed as nx-ovlloader×).\\n    - If Ultrahand deems there is not enough memory (at least 5.3 MB free after potential changes), then changes will not be applied.\\n2. Users can now completely exit the overlay system from the System Settings menu.\\n    - This will recover all memory consumed by nx-ovlloader / Ultrahand Overlay.\\n    - Users can then use Ultrahand-Reload.nro from homebrew launcher (now bundled with nx-ovlloader) to restart / reset nx-ovlloader without rebooting.\\n3. Commands move, copy, delete, and dot-clean memory optimizations.\\n    - Larger deletes, moves, and copies than v2.1.8 are now possible (even on a 4MB heap).\\n    - dot-clean now also removes all .DS_Store files for the specified directory (and subdirectories).\\n4. Now bundled with nx-ovlloader v2.0.0: https://github.com/ppkantorski/nx-ovlloader/releases/tag/v2.0.0 (which includes the new helper module nx-ovlreloader: https://github.com/ppkantorski/nx-ovlreloader).\\n    - nx-ovlloader+ compilation has been discontinued (no longer necessary).\\n    - The nx-ovloader+ zip on v2.0.0 is the same as nx-ovlloader.\\n        - It is provided for now during a grace period to ensure users can easily update from the system settings menu.\\n        - In the future after nx-ovlloader v2.0.0, if not on Ultrahand Overlay v2.2.0+, update methods might- be broken.\\n    - Side-note:- Users no longer need the /config/ultrahand/expansion/ folder and can safely delete it after updating.\\n5. Software updates now have the option to download a temporary update.ini command file (if provided on release) for micro managing the installation / update process.\\n    - Software updates instructions have also been slightly reworked for easier management.\\n6. Command exec now can be called with any package ini file (in addition to boot_package.ini like before).\\n    - Users can call this with exec <ENTRY_NAME> [ULTRAHAND_INI_FILE_PATH].\\n        - ULTRAHAND_INI_FILE_PATH in this case is an optional parameter, the path to the package ini file containing the command entry.\\n        - When not provided, it will assume commands from boot_package.ini (just like before).\\n7. Slight improvements to notifications (new tsl::notification->showNow implementation).\\n    - This allows instant display of the notification without waiting for the last notification to transition.\\n    - Packages can also use showNow via notify-now or notification-now (called the same way as notify / notification).\\n8. Sound effects now work on 6MB+ overlay heap sizes (disabled on 4MB).\\n9. Improvements to TrackBar touch.\\n10. Improvements to touch haptics (now to trigger on touch).\\n11. Improvements rounded rects and circles (slightly more refined AA).\\n12. Changes to socket initialization for improved memory usage (enables downloads on 4MB and improved memory).\\n13. Bug fix for haptics becoming disabled after sleep.\\n14. Bug fix for ;display_title= in packages interfering with proper returns to the last selected list item on the menu (as seen with returning from Alchemist).\\n15. Various tweaks, optimizations, bug fixes, and corrections.\\n\\nv2.1.8\\nList of changes:\\n1. AMS 1.10.0+ and HOS 21 support.\\n    - Overlays not recompiled with latest libnx no longer work without manual force enabling (potentially dangerous).\\n    - Unsupported overlays can now be hidden (toggle is within the settings menu).\\n        - Important:- All homebrew on AMS 1.10+ must to be recompiled with latest libnx for properly ensured support.\\n2. Anti-aliasing is now applied to rounded rects, uniform rounded rects, bordered rounded rects, and circles.\\n    - Overall smoother, less pixelated / jagged edges.\\n3. Slightly improved wallpaper loading speed + menu opening speed.\\n4. Memory expansion toggle / notification bug fix.\\n5. Initial state bug fix for main settings menu toggles.\\n6. Bug fix for ini file saving. (buffer was too large)\\n    - This fixes the open overlay command in Ultrahand packages.\\n7. Bug fix for ini file parsing not returning null on failed parsings.\\n8. Fixed Chinese font selection to ensure all glyphs display correctly on Traditional Chinese systems.\\n    - Special thanks to @BadFish-HSrui.\\n9. nx-ovlloader/nx-ovlloader+ has now been updated (v1.1.2) for AMS 1.10+ support.\\n10. libnx has been manually recompiled with -Os as well as several other code generation optimizations.\\n11. Various minor bug fixes and corrections.\\n\\nv2.1.7\\nList of changes:\\n1. Bug fix for notification text being drawn transparent when hidden (related to the global alpha limiter).\\n2. Bug fix for toggling Memory Expansion preventing users from exiting the Ultrahand settings menu.\\n3. Ini method optimizations (faster loading).\\n4. Proper menu return to last selected overlay / package when version labels are hidden.\\n    - A unique ID is now used to facilitate precise returns.\\n5. Widget backdrop now utilizes the alpha limiter.\\n6. Language config map (for the initial and repeated parsing of languages) is no longer static.\\n    - This should free up more memory in the global heap.\\n7. Slight improvements for haptics initializations (to prevent failed initializations that sometimes happen on first boot).\\n7. Various minor code optimizations.\\n\\nv2.1.6\\nList of changes:\\n1. Proper return to the last selected item after changing settings in the main Ultrahand settings menu.  \\n    - Ultrahand settings menu can also now be entered from the hidden overlays / packages page.  \\n2. Improved shake highlight animation.  \\n3. Faster wallpaper loading.  \\n4. Various rendering optimizations.  \\n5. Global alpha limiter for glyph rendering.\\n    - This will improve appearances when transitioning from shown to hidden and vise versa.\\n    - renderer->a is no longer needed for drawString calls in libultrahand.  \\n6. Bug fix for click animation not triggering on toggle list items.  \\n7. Various code optimizations (8kb smaller than v2.1.5).\\n\\nv2.1.5\\nList of changes:\\n1. New haptic feedback and sound effects options in Features under Miscellaneous in the settings menu.\\n    - Haptic feedback is off by default.\\n    - Sound effects are on by default, but require sound files: https://github.com/ppkantorski/Ultrahand-Overlay/tree/main/sounds to be added to /config/ultrahand/sounds/.\\n        - Users updating to v2.1.5 must run Update from the Software Update page one more time after updating  for the included sound effects to be properly installed.\\n        - Users can manually disable updates of the sound effect files by adding a file named NO_SOUND_EFFECTS_UPDATES.flag into /config/ultrahand/flags/.\\n    - Sound effects are only enabled on nx-ovlloader+, not regular nx-ovloader.\\n    - Side-note:- Sounds and haptics will also be applied to every overlay compiled with libultrahand v2.1.5+.\\n    - Notice:- Sound files must be relatively small to prevent memory related issues and keep latency low.\\n2. Transition bug fixes for cached List frames.\\n    - These fixes ensure the overlay list changes are synchronized with the top and bottom parts of the OverlayFrame during menu transitions.\\n3. Various refinements and bug fixes to the download file command.\\n    - Buffer sizes have been tweaked, memory related improvements applied, and boundary case crashes resolved.\\n4. Memory related improvements for copy and move commands running on the interpreter thread.\\n5. The \"Selection is empty!\" message is now properly centered, and applied to the overlay menu when no overlays have been added.\\n    - This ensures that translations are properly center text instead of drawing text misaligned.\\n6. Memory related improvements to wallpaper loading / reloading.\\n7. Cleanup of notification processing queue.\\n8. Cleanup of screenshots and recording layer initializations.\\n9. Various code refinements, bug fixes, and tweaks.",
