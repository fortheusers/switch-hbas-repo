        "details": "WARNING: This will overwrite Tesla Menu if already installed. Includes ppkantorski's nx-ovlloader fork. \\n\\nUltrahand Overlay is a Tesla Menu replacement built from the ground up off of libtesla that provides powerful C/C++ commands through the usage of its own custom interpretive programming language (similar to Shell/BASH). It is a versatile tool that enables you to create and share custom command-based packages, providing enhanced functionality for managing files and directories on your SD card.\\n\\nWith Ultrahand, you have the flexibility to customize and shape your file management system according to your needs, empowering you with greater control over your system configurations.\\n\\nSupport the dev on Ko-fi: https://ko-fi.com/ppkantorski"

    "changelog": "v2.1.5\\nList of changes:\\n1. New haptic feedback and sound effects options in Features under Miscellaneous in the settings menu.\\n    - Haptic feedback is off by default.\\n    - Sound effects are on by default, but require sound files: https://github.com/ppkantorski/Ultrahand-Overlay/tree/main/sounds to be added to /config/ultrahand/sounds/.\\n        - Users updating to v2.1.5 must run Update from the Software Update page one more time after updating  for the included sound effects to be properly installed.\\n        - Users can manually disable updates of the sound effect files by adding a file named NO_SOUND_EFFECTS_UPDATES.flag into /config/ultrahand/flags/.\\n    - Sound effects are only enabled on nx-ovlloader+, not regular nx-ovloader.\\n    - Side-note:- Sounds and haptics will also be applied to every overlay compiled with libultrahand v2.1.5+.\\n    - Notice:- Sound files must be relatively small to prevent memory related issues and keep latency low.\\n2. Transition bug fixes for cached List frames.\\n    - These fixes ensure the overlay list changes are synchronized with the top and bottom parts of the OverlayFrame during menu transitions.\\n3. Various refinements and bug fixes to the download file command.\\n    - Buffer sizes have been tweaked, memory related improvements applied, and boundary case crashes resolved.\\n4. Memory related improvements for copy and move commands running on the interpreter thread.\\n5. The \"Selection is empty!\" message is now properly centered, and applied to the overlay menu when no overlays have been added.\\n    - This ensures that translations are properly center text instead of drawing text misaligned.\\n6. Memory related improvements to wallpaper loading / reloading.\\n7. Cleanup of notification processing queue.\\n8. Cleanup of screenshots and recording layer initializations.\\n9. Various code refinements, bug fixes, and tweaks.",
