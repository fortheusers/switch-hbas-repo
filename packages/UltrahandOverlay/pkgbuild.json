        "details": "WARNING: This will overwrite Tesla Menu if already installed. Includes ppkantorski's nx-ovlloader fork. \\n\\nUltrahand Overlay is a Tesla Menu replacement built from the ground up off of libtesla that provides powerful C/C++ commands through the usage of its own custom interpretive programming language (similar to Shell/BASH). It is a versatile tool that enables you to create and share custom command-based packages, providing enhanced functionality for managing files and directories on your SD card.\\n\\nWith Ultrahand, you have the flexibility to customize and shape your file management system according to your needs, empowering you with greater control over your system configurations.\\n\\nSupport the dev on Ko-fi: https://ko-fi.com/ppkantorski"

    "changelog": "v2.2.1\\nList of changes:\\n1. New command mode ;mode=hold for triggering a \"hold A to execute\" type response (similar to default).\\n    - The pre-generated package.ini now utilizes ;mode=hold for its shutdown command.\\n2. New commands set-ini-val-matching-key, remove-ini-key-matching-key, and path_exists.\\n    - set-ini-val-matching-key will set an ini value to all ini sections that include the matching pattern key.\\n        - Called set-ini-val-matching-key <FILE_PATH> <PATTERN_KEY> <DESIRED_KEY> <DESIRED_VALUE>.\\n    - remove-ini-key-matching-key will remove all key value pairs from an ini from sections that include a matching pattern key.\\n        - Called remove-ini-key-matching-key <FILE_PATH> <PATTERN_KEY> <DESIRED_KEY>.\\n    - path_exists will return command success or failure based upon if the path provided exists or not.\\n        - Called path_exists <PATH>.\\n        - Can be quite useful when chained within try: blocks.\\n3. Placeholder replacement improvements for chaining with a source command.\\n    - In addition to ini_file (like before), users can now use the full catalogue of placeholders and chain them with their _source method definition.\\n    - Various improvements to placeholder replacements.\\n4. Slight refinements to list_file_source to include newlines when chained with tables.\\n    - Slight formatting improvements for tables on the ScriptOverlay.\\n5. New package Memory Kit: https://github.com/ppkantorski/Memory-Kit (latest revision of the old Memory Config: https://github.com/ppkantorski/Ultrahand-Overlay/tree/main/examples/Memory%20Config package example; Ultrahand v2.2.1+ only).\\n    - This package includes the mesosphere.bin memory hack: https://github.com/Craftyawesome/Atmosphere/tree/memory-hack (1.85 MB + stripped).\\n        - Keep in mind that the stripped version will break the web browser, which will cause crashes on certain games and apps that utilize the web browser.\\n        - The 1.85 MB version however should not have any issues.\\n    - Regular users should not- touch the Configure Commands tab as it is strictly available for development and testing of memory configurations for the libultrahand.\\n6. Improvement to haptics (stronger and more consistent feedback).\\n7. Bug fix for combos on forced AMS v1.10+ support overlays.\\n    - Combos were not working properly for overlays with forced support.\\n    - Forced AMS v1.10+ support is not recommended, but can still be used with manual patching overlay binaries.\\n        - It is highly recommended that all overlays get recompiled for proper AMS v1.10+ support.\\n8. New unsupported warning notification displayed when trying to launch an unsupported overlay.\\n9. All pages now get drawn with the cursor automatically set (no cursor flickering into view).\\n10. Bug fix for sluggish table scrolling after triggering a jump / wrap to bottom.\\n11. Bug fix for exit sound + haptics kicking in when combo launching an overlay during a notification.\\n12. Bug fix for degrees symbol on Chinese fonts.\\n13. Slight optimizations to stbtt_FindGlyphIndex_impl.\\n14. Various additional tweaks, bug fixes and corrections.\\n\\nv2.2.0\\nList of changes:\\n1. New overlay heap size configurations with automatic reloads (in the System Settings menu).\\n    - Default heap size for HOS 21+ is now set to 4MB (displayed as nx-ovlloader-).\\n        - Although rare, some overlays may not work properly on 4MB (without a fix implemented).\\n            - To fix some of these overlays, they should be using socketInitialize instead of socketInitializeDefault (if utilized).\\n            - Overlays should also not be utilizing a full 1280x720p framebuffer when on 4MB.\\n    - Default heap size for HOS 20 is now set to 6MB (displayed as nx-ovlloader).\\n    - Default heap size for HOS 19 and lower is now set to 8MB (displayed as nx-ovlloader+).\\n    - Users can also add a 4th higher option by adding to /config/ultrahand/config.ini a new section memory with key custom_overlay_memory_MB and an integer value (2MB intervals greater than 8MB only).\\n        - After adding that entry, a 4th memory option will appear (displayed as nx-ovlloader×).\\n    - If Ultrahand deems there is not enough memory (at least 5.3 MB free after potential changes), then changes will not be applied.\\n2. Users can now completely exit the overlay system from the System Settings menu.\\n    - This will recover all memory consumed by nx-ovlloader / Ultrahand Overlay.\\n    - Users can then use Ultrahand-Reload.nro from homebrew launcher (now bundled with nx-ovlloader) to restart / reset nx-ovlloader without rebooting.\\n3. Commands move, copy, delete, and dot-clean memory optimizations.\\n    - Larger deletes, moves, and copies than v2.1.8 are now possible (even on a 4MB heap).\\n    - dot-clean now also removes all .DS_Store files for the specified directory (and subdirectories).\\n4. Now bundled with nx-ovlloader v2.0.0: https://github.com/ppkantorski/nx-ovlloader/releases/tag/v2.0.0 (which includes the new helper module nx-ovlreloader: https://github.com/ppkantorski/nx-ovlreloader).\\n    - nx-ovlloader+ compilation has been discontinued (no longer necessary).\\n    - The nx-ovloader+ zip on v2.0.0 is the same as nx-ovlloader.\\n        - It is provided for now during a grace period to ensure users can easily update from the system settings menu.\\n        - In the future after nx-ovlloader v2.0.0, if not on Ultrahand Overlay v2.2.0+, update methods might- be broken.\\n    - Side-note:- Users no longer need the /config/ultrahand/expansion/ folder and can safely delete it after updating.\\n5. Software updates now have the option to download a temporary update.ini command file (if provided on release) for micro managing the installation / update process.\\n    - Software updates instructions have also been slightly reworked for easier management.\\n6. Command exec now can be called with any package ini file (in addition to boot_package.ini like before).\\n    - Users can call this with exec <ENTRY_NAME> [ULTRAHAND_INI_FILE_PATH].\\n        - ULTRAHAND_INI_FILE_PATH in this case is an optional parameter, the path to the package ini file containing the command entry.\\n        - When not provided, it will assume commands from boot_package.ini (just like before).\\n7. Slight improvements to notifications (new tsl::notification->showNow implementation).\\n    - This allows instant display of the notification without waiting for the last notification to transition.\\n    - Packages can also use showNow via notify-now or notification-now (called the same way as notify / notification).\\n8. Sound effects now work on 6MB+ overlay heap sizes (disabled on 4MB).\\n9. Improvements to TrackBar touch.\\n10. Improvements to touch haptics (now to trigger on touch).\\n11. Improvements rounded rects and circles (slightly more refined AA).\\n12. Changes to socket initialization for improved memory usage (enables downloads on 4MB and improved memory).\\n13. Bug fix for haptics becoming disabled after sleep.\\n14. Bug fix for ;display_title= in packages interfering with proper returns to the last selected list item on the menu (as seen with returning from Alchemist).\\n15. Various tweaks, optimizations, bug fixes, and corrections.",
