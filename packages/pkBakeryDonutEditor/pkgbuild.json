    "changelog": "v1.0.1\\nSave Backup Safety Checks\\n- Before backing up your save data, the app now checks if your SD card has enough free space (requires 2x the save file size).\\n- If space is low, a warning dialog shows how much space is available vs. needed, with the option to continue without a backup or cancel.\\n- If a backup fails for any other reason, you'll get a similar prompt before proceeding — no more silent failures.\\n\\nInitial Release\\n- Only compatible with Z-A version 2.0.1 !\\n"
