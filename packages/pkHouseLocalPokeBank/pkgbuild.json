    "changelog": "v1.3.0\\nImprovements & Fixes :\\n\\n- New Applet mode (album/HB menu): Bank-only access — All Games — two banks side by side for bank-to-bank transfers. Save data is not accessible in this mode.\\n- Banks that are currently in use cannot be deleted.\\n- When switching banks, the selector appears on the side being switched while the other panel stays visible.\\n- Bank switching now always saves your game and bank together to prevent data corruption.\\n\\nMulti-Select Improvements :\\n\\n- Drag selection : Hold Y and move with the D-Pad to select a rectangular group of Pokemon at once, instead of selecting them one by one.\\n- Select all : Double-tap Y to select every Pokemon in the current box. Selected slots are highlighted in green instead of cyan.\\n- Position-preserving placement : When using \"select all\" (green), Pokemon are placed at their original slot positions in the target box, allowing you to move an entire box layout as-is. All matching slots in the target must be empty.\\n- Regular selections (individual toggle and drag) continue to fill the first available empty slots as before.\\n\\nv1.2.0\\n- Implement all boxes overview for Save and Bank boxes (access with ZL / ZR)\\n\\nv1.1.0\\nFeature Release\\n\\n- Add _Let's Go Pikachu / Eevee_ support (game version 1.0.2)\\n\\n1.0.1\\nImplement full swap history to avoid losing pokemon when doing multiple in-place swaps then canceling with B button.\\n\\n1.0.0\\nInitial Release"
