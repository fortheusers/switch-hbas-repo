Selected slots are highlighted in green instead of cyan.\\n- Position-preserving placement : When using \"select all\" (green), Pokemon are placed at their original slot positions in the target box, allowing you to move an entire box layout as-is. All matching slots in the target must be empty.\\n- Regular selections (individual toggle and drag) continue to fill the first available empty slots as before.\\n\\nv1.2.0\\n- Implement all boxes overview for Save and Bank boxes (access with ZL / ZR)\\n\\nv1.1.0\\nFeature Release\\n\\n- Add _Let's Go Pikachu / Eevee_ support (game version 1.0.2)\\n\\n1.0.1\\nImplement full swap history to avoid losing pokemon when doing multiple in-place swaps then canceling with B button.\\n\\n1.0.0\\nInitial Release"
