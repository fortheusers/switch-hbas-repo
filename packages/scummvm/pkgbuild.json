    "changelog": "v2026.1.0\\nAnother year has gone by, therefore we are releasing a new ScummVM version. As you may notice right away, we are changing our version numbering schema, but that’s not all! We are also planning on more frequent releases!, which you can read about on sev’s blog: https://www.patreon.com/posts/new-milestone-in-149535385.\\n\\nThis could be the biggest release we have made so far in terms of the added features and engines. If I count correctly, we have added 12 new engines to our compatibility page. Not games, engines. In terms of games, it is challenging to count, since two of the engines, SLUDGE and WAGE are authoring tools, but if you count games in our detection tables, that adds up to at least 194 titles!\\n\\nAnd there is so much more...\\n\\n Changelog\\n\\n New games:\\n   - Added support for Dark Seed.\\n   - Added support for God of Thunder.\\n   - Added support for The Adventures of Willy Beamish.\\n   - Added support for Heart of China.\\n   - Added support for Nancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand.\\n   - Added support for Nancy Drew: Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake.\\n   - Added support for Ripley's Believe It or Not!: The Riddle of Master Lu.\\n   - Added support for Little Longnose.\\n   - Added support for Pilot Brothers 3: Back Side of the Earth.\\n   - Added support for Pilot Brothers 3D.
